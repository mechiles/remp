## [0.32.1] - 2022-05-02

### [Beam]

- Fixed IOTA issue with reading progress not being loaded on non-article pages. remp/remp#1096
- Fixed dashboard refresh issue if multiple landing pages were present on the dashboard. remp/remp#1112
- [Tracker] Added support for Google Cloud Pub/Sub message broker as replacement for Kafka. remp/remp#1097

### [Campaign]

- Added navigation links within the forms and UI to simplify following paths between banners and campaigns. remp/remp#1099

### [Mailer]

- Added support for `greybox` tag in generators. remp/remp#1060
- Added `List-Unsubscribe` header to outgoing emails. remp/remp#813 
- Changed batch email generator filter strategy. remp/remp#1086
  - Split complex `DELETE` queries in filter job queue functions into two step queries: `SELECT` array of ids to remove and simple `DELETE` query. In this way we want to prevent from potential deadlock that may occur in complex `DELETE` queries.
- Added support for configuration of goodbye email for unsubscribed users. remp/remp#1063
  - Added `unsubscribe_mail_template_id` into the `mail_types` table.
  - Added `unsubscribe_mail_template_code` parameter to the `/api/v1/mailers/mail-type-upsert` API to configure the welcome email.
  - Added new field for the subscription goodbye email in the newsletter edit/create form that provides system emails for selection.
  - Changed signature of `UserSubscriptionsRepository::unsubscribeUser()` and `UserSubscriptionsRepository::unsubscribeUserVariant()` - new `$sendGoodbyeEmail` argument was added.
- Added new emit of `user-unsubscribed` hermes event when user unsubscribes from the newsletter. remp/remp#1063
- Added retry ability to the hermes handler sending one-time emails. remp/remp#935
  - Until now, if there was an error during sending (Mailgun was unavailable, network was down), Mailer didn't try to send the email again.
- Fixed bug in `/api/v1/users/is-unsubscribed` response generation, altering response schema. remp/crm#1100
  - The endpoint never correctly generated the response, and it needed to be altered to be valid JSON. Since the endpoint never worked correctly, we mark this as bugfix and not a breaking change.
- Changed `/api/v1/mailers/mail-types` API to allow multiple `code` params to be specified as a filter. remp/crm#2387
- Added filtering by `mail_type_category_code` to the `/api/v1/mailers/mail-types` API. remp/crm#2387
- Added support for the localization of emails. remp/remp#1085
  - The UI stays same until you add secondary locale in the configuration of `Remp\MailerModule\Models\Config\LocalizationConfig`.
  - Emails are sent in default configured locale until the translation is available in secondary configured locale.

## [0.31.0] - 2022-03-14

### [Beam]

- Added support for displaying canonical URLs for non-article pageviews on Beam dashboard. remp/remp#832
- Added missing style (`display:relative`) in IOTA template badge. remp/web#1736
- Added caching mechanism for dashboard values (unique browser count) to avoid unnecessary requests for non-critical values. remp/remp#1090
  - The values are now periodically refreshed in the background every minute.

### [Mailer]

- Added configurable permission manager currently allowing limiting access to batch execution. See [README](https://github.com/remp2020/remp/tree/master/Mailer/extensions/mailer-module#permission-management) for more information. remp/remp#1087 
- Added HTML beautifier for HTML content of emails. remp/remp#684
  - WYSIWYG used to generate unformatted HTML which was hard to edit. All emails are now automatically beautified when they're edited.
- Added email fullscreen edit option for medium and wider devices. remp/remp#678
  - This feature is available in email edit page for both HTML and WYSIWYG editor

## [0.30.2] - 2022-02-26

### [Beam]

- Fixed XSS vulnerability on the SSO authentication error callback page.

### [Campaign]

- Fixed XSS vulnerability on the SSO authentication error callback page.

### [Sso]

- Fixed XSS vulnerability on the SSO authentication error callback page.

## [0.30.1] - 2022-02-22

### [Beam]

- Fixed retrieval of browser_id in `conversions:aggregate-events` command which leads to more thorough definition of user's conversion path. remp/remp#1049
  - Previously some events (mainly pageviews) could have been not matched correctly and missing in the aggregated data.
- Fixed occasional incorrect page_progress parameter being tracked causing progress update not to be tracked at all.
  - Due to JS floating points being JS floating points sometimes the page_progress was >1 which server refused to accept.
- Fixed issues with very slow author/section segment recalculation for instances with bigger amount of data. remp/remp#1088

## [0.30.0] - 2022-02-10

### Project

- Bumped reference version of Elasticsearch and Kibana to 7.17.0.

### [Beam]

- Fixed possibly too broad scope of IOTA requests. remp/remp#1050
  - If the articleSelector didn't match any articles, request was made without an `article_id` filter which could cause temporary Elastic unavailability.
- Added option to configure `--step=` of `pageviews:aggregate-articles-views` command to avoid Elasticsearch's _"Trying to create too many buckets"_ error. remp/remp#1050

### [Campaign]

- **BREAKING**: Removed loading `Noto Sans` and `Noto Sans Serif` fonts from campaign banner previews and use default system serif and sans-serif fonts. remp/remp#1041
  - You can change used fonts by adding `font-face` style to `.remp-banner .serif` and `.remp-banner .sans-serif` classes.
- Added custom configuration for `CampaignController::showtime` Sentry sample rate. remp/remp#1029

### [Mailer]

- **BREAKING**: The `/api/v1/mailers/send-email` API now validates context separately for each email address. This is a bugfix, but we label it as breaking because someone could depend on this behavior. remp/crm#2226
  - Previously the handler validated context globally, which was not intentional. It could have prevented a notification with the same context to be sent to different users. This change unifies the behavior with jobs - they checked the email-context pair since the beginning.
- **BREAKING**: Removed obsolete column `is_public` from `mail_types` table also from related code and API call. remp/remp#1061
  - Check your usage of `is_public` column - replace with `public_listing` column or remove.
  - The signature of method `ListsRepository::add()` changed. Check your usages of the method and incorporate the changes.
- Fixed inconsistent `PageMeta` use where constructor allowed to enter nullable values if they weren't present, but getter didn't allow to return them. remp/remp#1055
- Fixed incorrect handling of return values (null vs bool) caused by Nette 3.0 upgrade. remp/remp#1057
- Added checkbox for hiding newsletter from public newsletter settings. remp/remp#1025
- Fixed WP-based generator issue causing unnecessary `<br />` tags being appended to the `<a>` links. remp/remp#1065
- Fixed error in `ArticleUrlParserGenerator` caused by invalid URL. Mailer would crash instead of displaying error to the user. remp/remp#1066
- Added migration to add index on `email` column in `autologin_tokens` table. remp/remp#1067
- Added options to specify `variant_code` in the subscribe/unsubscribe APIs to complement subscription through `variant_id`. remp/crm#2212
- Added support for managing roles and privileges to Mailer. See [README](./Mailer/extensions/mailer-module/README.md#permission-management) for more information. remp/remp#1087
- Refactored mailer log filter (because of performance issues). remp/remp#1095
- Added `allowSearch` setting to DataTable component. remp/remp#1095

## [0.29.0] - 2021-11-18

### Project

- Removed obsolete `python-minimal` from Dockerfile to fix build error. remp/remp#1012
- Bumped reference version of Elasticsearch and Kibana to 7.15.2. remp/remp#1043
- Bumped reference version of Go in Docker images to 1.17.4. 

### [Beam]

- Added article content type filter to authors. remp/remp#1001
- Fixed missing search bar on mobile devices. remp/remp#932
- Added support for Redis Sentinel cluster in the app configuration. remp/remp#1035
  - Added new `REDIS_SENTINEL_SERVICE` environment variable to configure name of the Sentinel service. If used, sentinel hosts are expected to be configured in comma-separated `REDIS_URL` environment variable. 
- Added `article_external_id` into response of API call `/api/conversions`. remp/remp#1031
- Added information about article's tags, authors and sections into API call `/api/articles`. remp/remp#1031
- Property filter now correctly filters all sections of Beam, not just the main dashboard data. remp/remp#987
- Added `api/articles/read` API to list already read articles. remp/remp#1030

### [Mailer]

- **BREAKING**: Changed mail job batch status `STATUS_READY` to `STATUS_READY_TO_PROCESS_AND_SEND` in `BatchesRepository`. remp/remp#995
  - If you use `STATUS_READY` in your implementation, replace it with `STATUS_READY_TO_PROCESS_AND_SEND`.
- **BREAKING**: Added parameter for `code` attribute of mail type category into `ListCategoriesRepository::add()` method. remp/remp#675
  - The signature of method changed from `(string $title, int $sorting)` to `(string $title, string $code, int $sorting)`. Check your usages of the method and incorporate the changes.
- **BREAKING**: Changed initialization of DI services using Redis. If you use any of the following services, please amend your initialization in your `config.neon`. remp/remp#1035
  - Change `Tomaj\Hermes\Shutdown\PredisShutdown(@redisCache::client())` to `Tomaj\Hermes\Shutdown\PredisShutdown(@redisClientFactory::getClient())`
  - Change `Remp\MailerModule\Hermes\HermesTasksQueue(%redis.host%, %redis.port%, %redis.db%)` to `Remp\MailerModule\Hermes\HermesTasksQueue`
  - Change `Remp\MailerModule\Models\Job\MailCache(%redis.host%, %redis.port%, %redis.db%)` to `Remp\MailerModule\Models\Job\MailCache`
  - Change `Remp\MailerModule\Models\HealthChecker(%redis.host%, %redis.port%, %redis.db%)` to `Remp\MailerModule\Models\HealthChecker`
- **BREAKING**: Removed class `Remp\MailerModule\Models\RedisCache` in favor of `Remp\MailerModule\Models\RedisClientFactory`. remp/remp#1035
  - If you used `RedisCache` in your extensions, replace it with the use of `RedisTrait` and `RedisClientFactory`.
- **BREAKING**: Added flag to include deactivated users into interface method `Remp\MailerModule\Models\Users\IUser::list()`. remp/crm#1392
  - Default state is same as before _(returned only active users)_.
  - This is breaking change because now interface suggests that only active users are returned.
  - If you have own implementation of interface `IUser`, you should add new flag `$includeDeactivated` and handle it accordingly.
- Added new mail job batch status `STATUS_READY_TO_PROCESS`. remp/remp#995
- Added option to process mail job batch and get number of emails that will be sent in that batch. New button added to every mail job batch available when mail job batch is in `created` status. remp/remp#995
- Added `mail:remove-old-batches` command that removes mail job batches in `processed` status older than 24 hours. This prevents from using outdated emails set to send emails. remp/remp#995
- Added the prefilling of from field into ArticleUrlParserWidget after email's type is selected. remp/remp#999
- Fixed Article URL parser generator to ignore blank lines causing NULL requests to parse the URLs. remp/remp#1014  
- Removed obsolete RTM campaign parameter from Article URL parser generator.
- Added support for configuration of welcome email for new newsletter subscription. remp/remp#675
  - Added `subscribe_mail_template_id` into the `mail_types` table. 
  - Added `subscribe_mail_template_code` parameter to the `/api/v1/mailers/mail-type-upsert` API to configure the welcome email. 
  - Added new field for the subscription welcome email in the newsletter edit/create form that provides system emails for selection.
  - Changed signature of `UserSubscriptionsRepository::subscribeUser()` - new `$sendWelcomeEmail` argument was added.
- Added `code` column into the `mail_type_categories` table. Migration will take care of adding codes into the already existing categories. remp/remp#675
  - Added respective `code` attributes for mail type categories in `DatabaseSeedCommand`. 
- Added new emit of `user-subscribed` hermes event when user subscribes to the newsletter. remp/remp#675
- Added optional boolean `send_accompanying_emails` parameter into the `/api/v1/users/subscribe` and `/api/v1/users/bulk-subscribe` API endpoints. remp/remp#675
  - This parameter configures whether the subscription of newsletter should also trigger the welcome (and in the future goodbye) email for the newsletter.
- Changed Hermes `RedisDriver` sleep time from 5 seconds to 1 second. This should speed up some asynchronous operations. remp/crm#2046
- Fixed possible notice caused by missing `source_template_id` in the `ArticleUrlParserTemplateFormFactory`. remp/remp#1024
- Changed implementation of deprecated `Tomaj\NetteApi\Misc\BearerTokenRepositoryInterface` in favor of `Tomaj\NetteApi\Misc\TokenRepositoryInterface`. remp/crm#2052
- Added possibility to send B version of subject from `ArticleUrlParser`. remp/remp#982
- Changed how unique template code is acquired - instead od suffixing numbers, Mailer now appends random string to the end of mail template code. remp/remp#1027
  - All internal parts of Mailer which didn't use this feature and tried to get the code their own way now use provided `TemplatesRepository::getUniqueTemplateCode()` method.
- Removed unused repositories `LogEventsRepository` and `UsersRepository` _(leftovers after separation from CRM)_.
- Added API endpoint `/api/v1/users/delete` to remove all user data for provided email. remp/crm#1392
  - Added helper class `UserManager` with method `deleteUser()` to manage user deletion. remp/crm#1392
- Search bar can be toggled on mobile devices. remp/remp#932
- Improved memory footprint of `Remp\MailerModule\Models\Users\Crm::list` method by decoding JSON in stream. remp/remp#1040
- Added new command `mail:sync-deleted-users` (`SyncDeletedUsersCommand`) to handle deletion of emails which are not present in CRM _(loads users from implementation of `Remp\MailerModule\Models\Users\IUser` interface)_. remp/crm#1392

### [Campaign]

- Fixed missing search bar on mobile devices. remp/remp#932
- Fixed sorting issues on campaigns listing for multi-value columns (sorting was disabled). remp/remp#1034
- Added banner variant and segment filter to campaigns listing. remp/remp#1034
- Added support for Redis Sentinel cluster in the app configuration. remp/remp#1035
  - Added new `REDIS_SENTINEL_SERVICE` environment variable to configure name of the Sentinel service. If used, sentinel hosts are expected to be configured in comma-separated `REDIS_URL` environment variable.
- Fixed banner and campaign listings search. Grid was not able to search within campaign names (which is the main point of this search). remp/remp#1038
- Added `SENTRY_SHOWTIME_SAMPLERATE` env variable to configure sample rate of showtime logs/errors. remp/remp#1029
- Fixed campaign segments deleting when copying campaigns. After copying and creating a new campaign, the original had deleted segments originally assigned to it. remp/remp#1037

### [Sso]

- Fixed missing search bar on mobile devices. remp/remp#9322
- Added support for Redis Sentinel cluster in the app configuration. remp/remp#1035
  - Added new `REDIS_SENTINEL_SERVICE` environment variable to configure name of the Sentinel service. If used, sentinel hosts are expected to be configured in comma-separated `REDIS_URL` environment variable.

## [0.28.0] - 2021-09-09

### [Beam]

- **BREAKING**: Removed auto-enabling of AIRBRAKE error logging in case `AIRBRAKE_ENABLED` is missing. remp/remp#994
- *remplib.js* - added option to track article's `contentType` when tracking pageviews. remp/remp#988
    - **Breaking**: Derived parameter `is_article` in Elastic storage is set to `true` only if value of `contentType` is set to `'article'`. Previously, all tracked articles had `is_article` value set to `true`- this may affect Beam segments that worked with `article: true` rule or users processing `is_article` parameter in raw Elastic data.   
- Refactored beam `CompressAggregations` command to run in chunks because of colliding database transactions with `AggregatePageviewLoadJob` command, which caused deadlock. remp/remp#944
- Added `content_type` filter to the `api/articles/unread` API to exclude unwanted content types. remp/remp#973
- Added support for remplib.js reinitialization, necessary for correct execution in single-page apps. See [README](./Beam/README.md#single-page-applications) for more information. remp/remp#968
- Fixed broken `ArticleSeeder` and `EntitySeeder`.
- Fixed possibility of an error on the articles grids if filter matched too many articles. remp/remp#977
- Added `SameSite=Lax` attribute to all cookies set by `remplib.js`. Missing attribute could possibly lead to issues on Safari, which doesn't defaults to `Lax` like other browsers. remp/remp#957
- [Tracker] Added option to limit tracked time spent for one pageview. Set tracker's ENV variable `TRACKER_TIMESPENT_LIMIT` to desired pageview tracking threshold (in seconds). Helps to filter out tracking of articles opened for too long _(forgotten browser window on different workspace/monitor acts as active in some browsers)_. remp/remp#242
- [Tracker] Added support for canonical URL tracking to complement full URL tracking. If it's not found in the HTML, no canonical URL is stored and only regular URL is tracked. remp/remp#988
- Added tooltip to the user path chart. remp/remp#551
- Updated Docker Telegraf configuration to include `canonical_url` in the concurrents data. This will be necessary in the future to correctly display non-article traffic on the main dashboard. remp/remp#472
- Changed output of `service:elastic-data-retention` Beam command to correctly reflect if index was deleted or not. remp/remp#940
- [Segments] Fixed ignoring of segment's `active` flag in user/browser segment presence API check. remp/remp#1007
  - The bug caused that it was possible to check presence of users/browsers in segments even if the segment was not active.

### [Campaign]

- **BREAKING**: Removed auto-enabling of AIRBRAKE error logging in case `AIRBRAKE_ENABLED` is missing. remp/remp#994
- Fixed caching of Newsletter rectangle banner, which broke after the recent framework updates and caused configuration not to be available at the time of banner rendering. remp/remp#959
- Changed default stats view to include 30 days of data instead of 2 to allow bigger picture in campaign evaluation by default. remp/remp#969 
- Added support for remplib.js reinitialization, necessary for correct execution in single-page apps. See [README](./Campaign/README.md#single-page-applications) for more information. remp/remp#968
- Fixed unnecessary storing of empty URL/referer filters of "Where to display" section in campaign configuration. remp/remp#975
- Added `SameSite=Lax` attribute to all cookies set by `remplib.js`. Missing attribute could possibly lead to issues on Safari, which doesn't defaults to `Lax` like other browsers. remp/remp#957
- Added `rtmSource` to campaign's custom JS params, so clients can correctly track events without hardcoding the `rtmSource` to some arbitrary value.
- Added support for global campaign/banner variables. See [README](./Campaign/README.md#variables) for more information. remp/remp#972 
- Fixed missing `variables` template param in `BannerController->copy` method. remp/remp#991
- Fixed inefficient querying of campaign active status on campaign listing. remp/remp#1000
- Added support for pageview attributes to showtime request and added ui for configuring pageview attributes to campaign form. See [README](./Campaign/README.md#javascript-snippet) for more information. remp/remp#986
- Added error logging from showtime experiment `showtime.php` into `laravel.log`. remp/remp#994
- Added support for Sentry error logging from showtime experiment `showtime.php`. remp/remp#994

### [Mailer]

- **BREAKING**: Renamed `UrlParserGenerator` to `ArticleUrlParserGenerator`. remp/remp#949
  - Check your configuration if you are registering this generator.
- **BREAKING**: Finalized refactoring of `Remp\MailerModule\Repositories\IConversionsRepository` interface, removed obsolete methods. remp/remp#907
  - Methods `getBatchTemplatesConversions` and `getNonBatchTemplateConversions` were removed, because they encouraged suboptimal (non-time-constrained) implementation.
  - In your implementation replace them with newly added `getBatchTemplatesConversionsSince` and `getNonBatchTemplatesConversionsSince` respectively.
- **BREAKING**: Removed public preview URL specified by template code. remp/remp#581
  - **IMPORTANT**: The database migration can take up to 5-10 minutes, depending on the number of mail templates you currently have. Our testing migration with 100K templates took around 10 minutes.
  - Use replacement public preview URL specified by random string (so it's not guessable).
  - If you need to obtain HTML of email via template code, you can use newly added `/api/v1/mailers/render-template` API.
- Changed encoding of `mail_logs.subject` column to `uft8mb4_unicode_ci` to match encoding of `mail_templates.subject`. remp/remp#984
  - **IMPORTANT**: If you have more then 50M records in the `mail_logs` table, the `MailLogsSubjectEncoding` migration can be time-consuming. Consider raising your deploy timeout limits or mark the migration as complete and run the queries manually. Our testing migration with ~20M records took 3 minutes.
- Added email generator `ShopUrlParserGenerator` to get informations about products. remp/remp#949
- Fixed broken new email template page when no layout or newsletter list was defined.
- Added `SimpleAuthenticator`, which keeps plain list of emails and passwords that are valid to log in. Mailer can use this authenticator (instead of e.g. Sso `Authenticator`) to make it work without an external authentication system.
- Added support for `ignore_content_types` parameter in `UnreadArticlesResolver` used in generated/personalized e-mails. Parameter excludes articles of certain content types and avoids their use in generated e-mails. remp/remp#973
- Added public preview for emails (templates), accessible without authentication. Preview link is accessible in each email detail eg.: _(http://mailer.remp.press/template/show/1)_.  remp/remp#581
- Added API endpoint `/api/v1/mailers/render-template`. Returns a rendered HTML email. remp/remp#581
- Added widget for `ArticleUrlParserGenerator`. remp/remp#946
- Added demo user subscriptions in `demo:seed` command. 
- Added the check of cache to prevent display campaigns to users excluded from campaigns. remp/remp#833
- Fixed job unsubscribe stats inconsistency. remp/remp#993
  - Job detail (left panel) could display unsubscribes for non-related newsletter lists unsubscribed along with the sent newsletter.
- Added `ApplicationStatus` component, displaying online/offline status of Mailer workers. As follow up, `MissingConfiguration` component was removed and its functionality was merged into `ApplicationStatus` component. remp/remp#985

### [Sso]

- **BREAKING**: Removed auto-enabling of AIRBRAKE error logging in case `AIRBRAKE_ENABLED` is missing. remp/remp#994

## [0.27.1] - 2021-07-08

### [Beam]

- Fixed search issues on the author detail page. remp/remp#965
- Fixed missing journal dependency in the `/api/articles/unread` API. remp/remp#966

### [Campaign]

- Fixed type error issue in Campaign's showtime request if they were hit directly without any parameters. App now returns correct JSON error. remp/remp#964
- Fixed yarn lockfile issue causing installations with `--frozen-lockfile` option to fail.

### [Mailer]

- Added `page_url` to the response resources of the `/api/v1/mailers/mail-types` API. remp/crm#1946

## [0.27.0] - 2021-06-29

### Project

- Added `--explicit_defaults_for_timestamp` switch to the MySQL docker command to avoid unpredictable behavior when creating database tables - MySQL would set the default `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` to the first date column of each table. Make sure your production settings match to avoid issues.

### [Beam]

- **BREAKING**: Remplib.js is not automatically storing any query param to storage anymore. Only `rtm_*` keys and keys explicitly specified in `rempConfig.storageExpiration` are allowed. remp/remp#950
  - This only affects you if you rely on this behavior and expect to find any query parameters in the cookie/local_storage during the visit.
- Changed scheduled commands to run in background. remp/remp#942 
- Added `AggregatePageviews` command which groups article timespent/load commands. remp/remp#942
- Fixed possibly invalid aggregation of conversion data which caused time columns to be off due to the timezone issues. remp/remp#464
  - We decided to truncate all of the aggregations (they're temporary, they would be removed eventually) and trigger the aggregation internally again. You might see higher load after the release caused by `conversions:aggregate-events` and `conversions:process-sources` commands.
- Added `/api/pageviews/histogram` API endpoint to get pageviews histogram for selected date range. See [README.md](./Beam/README.md) for more details. remp/remp#953
- [Segments]: Fixed "Trying to create too many scroll contexts" error caused by the amount of opened scrolls in Elastic and loose close timeouts which could happen on selected queries. remp/remp#464
- Fixed issue with API calls generating PHP sessions on each request, causing session store to be overloaded with records. remp/remp#954
- Added support for article external ID in the global search. remp/remp#955
- Fixed account listing broken in the latest release. remp/remp#958

### [Campaign]

- Introduced `public_id` row to reach unique identifications with shorter string. remp/remp#916
- Replaced `uuid` campaign's identification with shorter `public_id` in cookies and local storage. remp/remp#916
- Fixed issue with API calls generating PHP sessions on each request, causing session store to be overloaded with records. remp/remp#954

### [Mailer]

- **BREAKING**: Extended `IConversionsRepository` interface with `getBatchTemplatesConversionsSince()` function. remp/remp#907
- **BREAKING**: Proprietary Mailer classes' namespace was changed from `Remp/MailerModule` prefix to `Remp/Mailer`. In the future, these classes may be completely removed from the repository. If you have previously relied on their functionality, make sure you reflect on this change and ideally copy the functionality into your own code. remp/remp#924
  - List of affected widgets: `DennikeWidget`, `MediaBriefingWidget`, `MMSWidget`, `NewsfilterWidget`, `NovydenikNewsfilterWidget`, `TldrWidget`
  - List of affected form factories: `DennikeTemplateFormFactory`, `MediaBriefingTemplateFormFactory`, `MMSTemplateFormFactory`, `NewsfilterTemplateFormFactory`, `NovydenikNewsfilterTemplateFormFactory`, `TldrTemplateFormFactory` 
  - List of affected generators: `DailyNewsletterGenerator`, `DennikeGenerator`, `DennikNBestPerformingArticlesGenerator`, `MediaBriefingGenerator`, `MinutaAlertGenerator`, `MinutaDigestGenerator`, `MMSGenerator`, `NewsfilterGenerator`, `NovydenikNewsfilterGenerator`, `TldrGenerator`
  - `ContentInterface` implementations: `DenniknContent`, `NovydenikContent`, `TyzdenContent`
- **BREAKING**: Handler confirming CRM user `Remp\MailerModule\Hermes\ConfirmCrmUserHandler` is replaced with `Remp\MailerModule\Hermes\ValidateCrmEmailHandler`. remp/crm#1740
  - This conforms with the latest changes in the CRM which splits user confirmation and email validation flagging. If you used this handler in your `config.local.neon`, please replace it with the new one.
  - This version requires CRM 0.32.0+, otherwise the confirmation APIs would return HTTP 404. After the upgrade, make sure the API key used to communicate with CRM has access to the `Users:EmailValidationApi` API by visiting `/api/api-access-admin/` in the CRM.
- Added missing login error messages if REMP CRM is used to authenticate the user.
- Added option to identify source template by code in `MailGeneratorPreprocessHandler`. remp/remp#941

### [Beam]

- **BREAKING**: Upgraded to Laravel 8. remp/remp#491
  - Make sure that when including `remplib` library (built with production settings), your HTML document has defined character encoding, otherwise `remplib` might not be initialized correctly. Character encoding can be specified using `meta` tag, e.g. `<meta charset="UTF-8" />`.
- Fixed sorting of referer stats in the article detail. The default sorting is now again Visits count. remp/remp#934
- Changed default order sequence for numeric columns to be descending first. remp/remp#934
- Fixed incorrect pageviews count bug in `/top` APIs when using filters. remp/remp#937
- Added optional `APP_TRUSTED_PROXIES` environmental variable. IP/HTTP related headers will only be allowed from trusted proxy. All proxies are trusted by default.

### [Beam]

- **BREAKING**: Upgraded to Laravel 7. remp/remp#491
  - All API endpoints now return dates in ISO-8601 compatible format. Make sure all code consuming the Beam API is accustomed to this change. For example, previously, date would serialized like the following: `2019-12-02 20:01:00`. Now it is serialized like `2019-12-02T20:01:00.283041Z` (always in UTC).
  - Environment variable `APP_SESSION_EXPIRATION` was renamed to `SESSION_LIFETIME`.
- Added `/api/articles` list articles info api endpoint. remp/remp#909

### [Campaign]

- **BREAKING**: Upgraded to Laravel 7. remp/remp#491
  - All API endpoints now return dates in ISO-8601 compatible format. Make sure all code consuming the Campaign API is accustomed to this change. For example, previously, date would serialized like the following: `2019-12-02 20:01:00`. Now it is serialized like `2019-12-02T20:01:00.283041Z` (always in UTC).
  - Environment variable `APP_SESSION_EXPIRATION` was renamed to `SESSION_LIFETIME`.
- Fixed broken campaign comparison. remp/remp#926
- Fixed broken campaign copying. remp/remp#927

- Added newsletter subscribers list into the newsletter detail section. remp/remp#873
- Changed email filter to use fulltext search for `mail_body_html`. remp/remp#595
  - **WARNING**: The migration adding the fulltext index to speed up the search can take longer than usual. Testing migration lasted ~5 minutes for 1GB of `mail_templates` MySQL table data (~100K rows). The table is locked for writes during the migration and Mailer will not be able to create/update emails during the migration period. Please release this version in less exposed time.
- Added sorting inputs to mail source template form and use ascending sorting. remp/remp#918
- Added `code` to mail layouts. Code of existing layout was generated based their ID and name. remp/remp#917

- Changed the format of stored tracking parameters in cookies and local storage. remp/remp#889
- Added option to set timeout for Beam and Pythia segments. remp/remp#899
- Removed API's throttle (rate limiting). APIs `SegmentCacheController@addUserToCache` and `SegmentCacheController@removeUserFromCache` have to receive more requests than predefined limit. Will be enabled back with Laravel 8. remp/remp#913
- Upgraded to Laravel 6. remp/remp#491

### [Mailer]

- Converted database to UTF8mb4 encoding. Migration can take some time according to the volume of data in the database. remp/remp#895

## [0.19.0] - 2021-02-16

### Important

We have identified possibly incorrectly stored values in `timestamp` columns of Beam/Campaign/SSO applications.

This issue could have occurred if your database time_zone was not set to the UTC and used any other local timezone. All features worked correctly, but the underlying date was not stored correctly and issues could have emerged later.

If you're not sure if your database is in UTC, follow these steps to verify and fix the issue. Otherwise you could see incorrect dates in the app after the update to this version. 

1. Check whether your database is configured in UTC. Please run following query in Beam:
    ```sql
    select published_at, convert_tz(published_at, '+00:00', @@session.time_zone) from articles order by published_at desc limit 1;
    ```
    The result will look like this:
    ```
    +---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    | published_at        | convert_tz(published_at, '+00:00', @@session.time_zone) |
    +---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    | 2021-01-25 14:01:04 | 2021-01-25 15:01:04                                     |
    ```

2. If the two dates are the same, your DB uses UTC and you're fine. Otherwise, proceed to this tutorial: https://gist.github.com/rootpd/c5e04612e47c80a10635a0477a4afa8e.

### [Beam]

- Added option to filter top articles and top tags by author. remp/remp#803
- [Segments]: Improved live caching of segments, avoiding queries that are not necessary to execute.
- [Segments]: Explicitly closing open Elastic scrolls once we don't need them anymore, since they're expensive to maintain for Elastic.
- Added explicit DB connection time zone to enforce UTC communication between application and database. remp/remp#809
- Added command for processing of conversion sources that runs in batch mode or for specific conversion (`php artisan conversions:process-sources [--conversion_id]`). remp/remp#464
  - Added new `conversion_sources` table. remp/remp#464
  - Processing of conversion sources is also invoked in conversion upsert endpoint right after aggregation of conversion events. remp/remp#464

  - Replace the use of `Tomaj\Hermes\Restart\RedisRestart` to `Tomaj\Hermes\Shutdown\RedisShutdown`.
  - Replace the use of `Tomaj\Hermes\Restart\SharedFileRestart` to `Tomaj\Hermes\Shutdown\SharedFileShutdown`.
- Added support for custom Message-ID headers in Mailer in Mailgun implementation. Mailgun reused same Message-ID for all emails within one batch which could cause unexpected behavior. remp/remp#801
- Fixed type-related issue with Mailgun event daemon processor which caused synchronization not to work.
- Added support for Hermes message priorities. See `app/config/config.local.neon.example` for example use of registering multiple priority queues for Hermes.
- Fixed injection of `UNSUBSCRIBE_URL` environment variable into the email parameters. Sender was injecting only name of the newsletter list instead of the whole `UNSUBSCRIBE_URL` with `%type%` replaced with the actual newsletter list code. remp2020/remp#87
- Added option to configure which mailer to use for each mail type (list) separately. remp/remp#793

### [Sso]

## [0.18.0] - 2021-01-14

### [Beam]

- Added caching of colors order in dashboard (order is first assigned according to predefined order and number of traffic per each referer medium). remp/remp#719
- Added missing IE11 polyfill to support `Promise` in IE11. remp/remp#795
- Added support to track IDs of user's subscriptions granting access to content. remp/analytika#11

### [Mailer]

- Added option to show mail template by code in `TemplatePresenter->showByCode` method. remp/crm#1626

## [0.17.0] - 2020-12-21

### Important

- **BREAKING**: All REMP applications now primarily use *rtm* parameters (our replacement for *utm* parameters, to avoid conflicts with other tracking software).
When deploying this release, **you have to deploy the Segments/Journal app first and the Tracker app second**. Everything else (Beam, Campaign, Mailer, SSO) **has to be deployed afterwards** (the order doesn't matter). This is due to the internal change in how Tracker stores *rtm* parameters in underlying Elasticsearch storage. 
- **BREAKING**: Segments/Journal app aggregations using *utm* parameters (namely `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_medium`, `utm_source` and `banner_variant`) has to be rewritten to use *rtm* parameters (`rtm_campaign`, `rtm_content`, `rtm_medium`, `rtm_source` and `rtm_variant`). If one wants to aggregate old data (with `utm_` parameters) together with new data, it has to be done in two separate calls to Segments API (one with `utm_` and another one with `rtm_` aggregation parameters).

### Project

- Fixed PHP 7.4 docker image build dependencies.

### [Mailer]

- Fixed issues with settings page caused by internal config names renaming. remp/crm#1616

- Fixed scenario in JS library when fallback `cookie` value expiration was not updated with the main `local_storage` expiration.
- [Tracker]: Added new parameter `commerce_session_id` to `track/commerce` endpoint of API tracker. remp/crm#1559
- Added new identifier `commerce_session_id` into `remplib.js` to identify unique commerce process. remp/crm#1559 
- [Segments]: UTM to RTM parameters transition. remp/remp#779
- [Tracker]: UTM to RTM parameters transition. remp/remp#779
- Removed statically set `memory_limit` configuration within some memory-extensive commands. remp/remp#788
- Added support for configurable memory limit for each command via `COMMANDS_MEMORY_LIMITS` environment variable. See [`.env.example`](Beam/.env.example) for more information. remp/remp#788
- Improved dashboard graph - snapshots of concurrent data are mapped to fixed time points to avoid displaying glitches in graph. remp/remp#763
- Changed scheduled aggregation and snapshotting command calls to be non-blocking (so they don't wait for each other to be executed). remp/remp#763
- Command `composer install` now works without DB connection (removed check for `migrations` table)

### [Campaign]

- Fixed issue with slow pageview processing queries due to string/int type conflict in the query parameters. remp/remp#766
- [Segments]: Fixed `search.max_buckets` Elastic issue when aggregating too big chunk of pageviews data. Changed internal implementation of Segments API, aggregation is now using Elastic composite aggregation and pagination. remp/remp#662 
- [Segments]: Fixed return type of count histogram items. Float was changed to int as count can always return integers anyway. remp/remp#622
- [Segments]: Removed `offset` parameter for histograms. Beam APIs haven't used it and composite index (new Elastic-7-friendly implementation) doesn't support it yet. remp/remp#622
- Added filter by content type to conversion, article pageviews, article conversions and author detail listing. remp/remp#769
- Added ability to compute section stats segments using `ComputeSectionSegments` command + added configuration category and items for this feature + added test configuration screen which uses command to generate results and sends them to specified email address. remp/remp#424

### Important

**Elasticsearch upgrade notice.** We'll be raising Elasticsearch compatibility to 7.* in the next release. Up until now, Segments API supported Elasticsearch 6.*.

We recommend two upgrade scenarios:

- When new release is ready, you can upgrade your existing cluster based on the documentation available at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html.
- If you clear your Elastic data recurrently and archive stored events to CSV, you can spin up new v7 cluster and configure [Telegraf](./Docker/telegraf/telegraf.conf) to push data to both v6 and v7 of Elastic. Once you're satisfied with the amount of data in v7 (~1 month tends to be sufficient), wait for the next release and change Elastic address in Segments API to v7 cluster. If there are no issues, you can stop pushing new events to v6 cluster in Telegraf and stop the cluster completely. 

### Docker

- **BREAKING**: Replaced `spotify/kafka` docker image with `wurstmeister/kafka` as original image was no longer maintained and new installations stopped working. remp/remp#638
  
  - In case you have existing installation in place using the docker compose, please run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose stop beam_tracker telegraf
    docker-compose rm beam_tracker telegraf
    docker-compose build beam_tracker telegraf
    ```

### [Mailer]

- **BREAKING**: Attachment parameter in `send-email` API is now required to be base64-encoded to support PDF (and other binary) attachments.
- **BREAKING**: Context checking during email sending now only checks if user received an email with given context before; Mailer ignores `mail_template_code` being sent. In previous version, two different mail templates with same context could be sent to the same user. This version prevents such behavior. remp/crm#987
- **BREAKING**: Removed hardcoded support for Errbit/Airbrake error logging, added support for Sentry logging. See README for details on how to configure Sentry to track errors.

  ```
  bannerUrlParams:  {
      "foo": function() { return "bar" },
      "baz": function() { return "XXX" }
  }
  ```

- HTML banner now supports custom JS and CSS inclusion from external sources.
